Jon Kruger: .NET TDD Immersion (Tuesday Half Day PM),01/08/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,Indigo,.NET,"TDD Immersion covers everything you need to know to do test-driven development on real .NET projects. We'll go over stuff like how to write tests first, how to refactor your code to make it easier to test, mocking frameworks like Moq, dependency injection with StructureMap, and other TDD tips and tricks I've learned from doing TDD over the years.

We'll also walk through a sample ASP.NET MVC web app and show you how you might set up an actual project, work with ORMs and data access layers, set up your test projects, and make things easy to test.  We'll end with some TDD practice to help you hone your TDD skills, so bring your laptop (or pair up with someone who has one). TDD has revolutionized the way that I write code and it can do the same for you!

Carol J. Smith: “Users are Losers! They’ll Like Whatever we Make” and Other Fallacies. ,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Salon H,Design/UX,"If this sounds familiar it is time to make big changes or look for a new job. Failing your users will only end badly. In this session we’ll look at the assumptions that are all-too-often made about users, usability and the User Experience (UX). In response to each of these misguided statements Carol will provide a quick method you can conduct with little or no resources to debunk these myths. "
JC Grubbs: A Practical Guide to CSS3 - CANCELLED,01/10/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Salon H,Design/UX,"THIS SESSION HAS BEEN CANCELLED

Modern web applications push the envelope toward feeling more and more ""native"", and today many developers are taking a single-page approach to building complex apps.  As our interactions become more complicated so do our styling requirements.  Animations, transitions, highly stylized elements, web fonts, responsive layouts all add to the complexity of our projects.  In this talk, JC will help untangle some of the features of CSS3 that we can use today.  He'll show us some helpful tools like SASS and Bourbon for helping to better organize our styling while maintaining cross-browser compatibility.

This talk will focus on:

- CSS3 animations and transitions
- Advanced layout with CSS3 Flex-box
- Element styling (shadows, border radius, multiple backgrounds, gradients, etc)
- Typography, web fonts and icon fonts
- Using media queries
- An introduction to SASS and the Bourbon library"
Javier Lozano: Advanced ASP.NET MVC - CANCELLED,01/10/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Sagewood/Zebrawood,.NET,"SESSION CANCELLED 

In this session we will look at different techniques that leverage extensibility points within ASP.NET MVC to make the most of your applications.  If you've ever wanted to know how you can do more with less within MVC, this is a session you don't want to miss!"
Peter Ritchie: Advanced Unit Testing Design and How it Applies to Stakeholders,01/10/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Testing,"Automated testing provides a way for developers to validate a certain level of quality. But, automated testing provides much, much more than that. Automated tests form the basis of many types of documentation, if you let them.

This session details how you can build on your automated testing successes by detailing how organize and name your test classes and test methods to make your tests work for you. Your tests can be the reference documentation for your internal APIs. Tests can validate code but they can also validate requirements and acceptance criteria. When tests are well organized, they can be used to round-trip requirements and acceptance criteria to give stakeholders full round-trip validation by generating human-readable documentation based on certain tests. This session also details ways to reflect certain types of tests to document how tests are validating requirements and acceptance criteria."

"Barry Hawkins: Agile, Lean, and the Space Between",01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Nile,Agile,"In early 2001, ""Agile"" was coined as the umbrella term for Scrum, XP, ASD, DSDM, Crystal, and a few other methodologies. In 2003, Mary and Tom Poppendieck published the book ""Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit"", and the term Lean Software Development became known among a subset of the larger Agile community.

For years, one could assume that any development group trying to improve its approach to software was applying some form of Agile Software Development methodology. In the last couple of years, Lean Software Development has seen a surge in popularity. Some groups adopting Lean perceive it as an alternative to Agile processes like Scrum, and express a sense of elitism and superiority, having ""moved beyond Agile"".

While Agile Software Development and Lean Software Development originate from different sources, they are actually closely related and share a great deal of overlap. In this talk attendees will discover where each came from, and just how much of Agile and Lean are shared in the space between."
"Michael Pardo: Android Custom Views, the Right Way",01/10/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Zambezi,Mobile,"Android is a very powerful framework that has just about everything you'll need out of the box. For everything else, Android includes a sophisticated and powerful framework for creating the crazy UI you have in mind. Learn the three main methods we use to create custom views, and all the tips you'll need to write code that fits right in with the Android Open Source Project."
John Lindquist: AngularJS: The HTML of the Future,01/11/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Salon D,JavaScript,"Come learn how AngularJS (http://www.angularjs.org/) can extend HTML vocabulary for your own applications and build reusable HTML components that you can share across projects. We'll also focus on how easy it is to connect to services and bind to any data source to quickly build up very rich applications.

William Klos: Applying Pizza Delivery Lessons to Emergency Helicopter Dispatching,01/10/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Nile,Ruby,"A case study for building a set of custom applications to request and monitor emergency helicopters for use in hospitals.

For this project we decided to build our cloud app with a hodgepodge of parts: Heroku, Ruby, Sinatra, CouchDB and Redis. and for our user interface: a native iOS app running on iPads - with a JSON REST API tying it all together.

We will answer questions like: ""Where does pub/sub beat queuing?"", ""Do I really need to cache my REST calls?"", and ""Why doesn't this scale - I added more memory?"""
Dianne Marsh: Atomic Scala (Wednesday Full Day),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,5:30 PM,H,Scala,"This seminar is based on our book Atomic Scala, which takes away the pain of learning by breaking subjects into the smallest chunks we could (we call them ""atoms""). Even (dedicated) first-time programmers can learn Scala with this book, but the design also makes it the most expedient way for experienced programmers to get started with Scala.
We present each Atom (chapter) in the book as a very short lecture, followed by an exercise period. Atomic concepts make learning Scala easy and fun.
Topics
Scala is an amazing and elegant language. It's also powerful, and overwhelming if you try to absorb it all at once. Our goal is to present the language in small bites that you can quickly grasp, to give you a foundation on which you build more knowledge.
This 1-day precompiler is based on our weeklong format. We want you to finish the day feeling strong and ready to learn more about Scala. To achieve this we have selected a subset of topics that, once learned, allow you to create useful and interesting programs; a base from which you can increase your knowledge. We have carefully trimmed away topics that you don't need to know right away (but that you'll be able to acquire more easily from books or more advanced courses).  We’ll send installation instructions prior to CodeMash, so that we can jump right into learning Scala.

James Bender: BDD in .NET with SpecFlow,01/10/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Testing,"A key concept of any Agile methodology is communication. It’s no longer normal or acceptable for developers to sit and develop applications in isolation from the business. To that end, developers and business domain experts have been trying to find better ways to communicate. While developers tend to speak in terms of “code and technology” most business domain experts are more comfortable communicating in terms of scenarios, workflows and business rules.
 Test Driven Development (TDD) was the first step in getting these two groups to communicate in the same way. Developers could write unit tests that expressed business requirements with the hope that business users could validate that what was being tested was in fact what the desired behavior was. But, unit tests are still code and while it was better, the communication was still stilted and inefficient.

To help this communication new techniques such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) have become popular. Along with these new ideas, new tools like SpecFlow have become popular as a means to express unit tests in a way that the business can better understand and validate.

This session will demonstrate how SpecFlow can be leveraged in your BDD or ATDD practices. In this session you will learn what SpecFlow is and how to integrate it into your .NET project. The Gherkin language and the “Given, When, Then” paradigm will be explained. You will see how to write tests in a way that business users are not only capable of reading, but can also help you create them.

Bill Heitzeg: Becoming a software strategist,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Nile,Business,"As Software developers we are literally on the front-line everyday.  We’re creating software and delivering it at both an exhilarating and sometimes exhausting pace.  We use Agile to get our customer involved in our process.  What we are often missing is getting ourselves involved in our customer’s process. In this session you’ll learn how to vastly improve the software you deliver by becoming a software strategist. You’ll be given the tools that will allow to create a written strategy that any MBA will be impressed with.  You’ll learn how to create effective steering committees.  Most importantly, you’ll learn how to become a part of strategic decision making before it happens.  Strategy is the essential first step into building great software, by learning and applying these techniques, you be immeasurably helping yourself and your organization."
Steve Smith: Beginning Software Craftsmanship (Wednesday Half Day AM),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,Cypress,Craftsmanship,"In this interactive session, you'll learn some of the basic principles and practices of writing better quality code: testing and pairing.  You'll work with a variety of partners on coding katas designed to instill best practices that you'll then be ready to apply when next you work on production code.  This session is led by the organizers of the Hudson Software Craftsmanship group and provides a great introduction to the afternoon's Intermediate Software Craftsmanship session (though this is not a prerequisite for that session).  Attendees should already be comfortable with a programming language of their choice and if possible should bring along a laptop computer with their development tools installed, including a unit testing tool.

Chris Gardner: Beginning Xbox 360 Development with the XNA Framework,01/10/2013,9:45 AM,10:45 AM,Indigo Bay,Game Development,"While many of us dream of jobs in game development, XNA Game Studio gives you the tools necessary to make and publish your own games for the Xbox Live Indie Games Marketplace. Attendees will given a brief overview of using XNA Game Studio to create software for the Xbox 360. Topics include basic sprite manipulation, controller inputs, and basic collision detection."
Nayan Hajratwala: Better Metrics for your Team,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Nile,Software Process,"Are you still measuring the performance of your team with Velocity, Estimates vs. Actuals, Code Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, and “style violations”? Are your business stakeholders still in the dark about when they can expect new features? If so, you’re missing the boat.

The good news is that there are more powerful and reliable metrics that are cheaper to derive. Trust me, you will love these metrics and they will love you back.

You’ll walk away from this session understanding the purpose of capturing metrics, how few you actually need, and participate in an interactive game showing you how to capture them.

Learning outcomes:
* Ability to use Throughput and Cycle Time on your projects to effectively communicate your team's performance to your business stakeholders.
* Ability to use statistical models to provide ""when will this get done"" answers to your business stakeholders.
* Understanding of the interwoven relationship of Work In Process, Cycle Time, and Throughput.

Jim Weirich: Better Testing with Given/When/Then,01/10/2013,9:45 AM,10:45 AM,Portia/Wisteria,Ruby,"Do you struggle with writing good tests? Do you want your executable specs to read like real specifications and not just code you have to wade through to understand?

Given/When/Then is an extension library for RSpec designed to take RSpec's excellent DSL for defining English-like specifications and taking it to the next level. Given/When/Then allows developers to clearly state what behaviors are being specified, what are the preconditions for that behavior, and what outcomes are expected under various scenarios.

This talk will cover not only the basics of Given/When/Then, but also best practices for writing readable and robust specifications that are not brittle when faced with code refactoring.

Justin Searls: Budgeting Reality: a Nuanced Discussion on Mock Objects,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Sagewood/Zebrawood,Testing,"Our community's conversations about mock objects lack nuance, rigor, and thoughtfulness. This talk puts us on a path toward fixing that.

Some say ""mocks suck,"" because they reduce a test's realism and, therefore, our confidence that the code being tested actually works. Others use mocks to demarcate the outer boundary of an application, guarding the test from expensive or external dependencies (e.g. by faking a database or network resource). Still others see mocks as a ""setup of last resort"", using them only to mitigate the pain of hard-to-test code. Finally, some developers mock out every collaborator in every test, and their rationale is probably the least understood of them all!

This talk will serve as an opinionated (if broad-stroke) survey of the different ways people use test doubles (be they mocks, fakes, stubs, or spies). Our goal will be to establish a more sophisticated means of communicating on the topic. We'll discuss the pros & cons of the different approaches toward mocking, the smells of test double abuse, and the lessons I took away from writing my own test double library. 

Most importantly, the talk will emphasize why knowing what value we want from a test is a prerequisite to knowing the merits of using mock objects to write that test. Reality is expensive, and it's more valuable to some types of tests than to others."
Will Dages: Build a Cloud App In an Afternoon With Parse,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Rosewood,Mobile,"Ideas are cheap, but development time isn't. So what happens when you find yourself with nothing but a great idea and a free afternoon? Using Parse (www.parse.com) can be a great option for getting a cloud app up and running fast, without having to worry about back-end infrastructure, server maintenance, or scaling issues. 

Even if you love building your own APIs, you can use Parse à la carte to simplify Push Notifications (iOS & Android), In-App Purchases (iOS) or User Signups & Logins (with password recovery).

We'll dive into the API by going through a real setup and writing a simple web app that you'll be able to interact with immediately. I'll also be showcasing real code examples from more complex apps running Parse for their backend, and run though some prototyping use cases. In addition to the benefits, we'll also discuss some potential drawbacks of using this in a deployed app.

(Note, I do not have any affiliation with Parse. It's just a great service that has saved me countless hours of time, and I'd love to share my experiences with it.)"
Mike Benkovich: Building against the Microsoft Data Stack,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Sagewood/Zebrawood,.NET,"WebAPI or OData? WCF or ASMX? XML or JSON? Data is the core of why we build systems and solutions and look for opportunities to automate and simplify. What are the options and when do you make the tradeoffs? In this session, we look at what's new with the Microsoft ADO.NET Entity Framework and explain how it works with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), Representational State Transfer (REST), and RIA Data Services. We also explore the technologies and the trends that are driving the frameworks to see how to take advantage of these new technologies."
Jimmy Bogard: Building External DSLs for Fun and Profit,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Guava/Tamarind,.NET,"We've all seen the explosion of fluent interfaces and internal DSLs with the language-oriented features of recent releases of C#. Dynamic languages extend the boundaries even further, where we can bend the programming languages to our will.

But what if we want to move beyond the barriers of the programming language and into actual external, executable DSLs? In this session, we'll look at the landscape of lexers, parsers, grammars and trees to see how we can use these tools to build external DSLs that business users will actually enjoy using. We'll also look at how we can take those trees and transform them into real, executable code.

Finally, we'll see where to use external DSLs (and where not to use them) to build systems with truly dynamic behavior.

Chris Adamson: Building Productive iOS 6 Apps (Wednesday Half Day PM),01/09/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,Aloeswood/Lepoardwood,iOS,"It can't all be about the games; the App Store has lots of other categories, like productivity, utility, business, navigation, lifestyle, and so on. So for this year's afternoon iOS precompiler, we're going to look specifically at some of the features in the iOS SDK that help you write apps that will make users more productive. We'll build off the experience of the morning session and create apps that can save files to the device or iCloud, and exchange them with other apps on the device. We'll also look at some of the other options for persisting data, and exchanging it via copy-and-paste.
But no device is an island, so we'll also introduce some of the ways iOS apps can exchange data with the internet, from opening URLs to sending mail and Tweets.
Attendees will need the latest version of XCode from the Mac App Store. For the iCloud example to work, you need to run on the device, which in turn requires membership in Apple's $99/year iOS Developer Program, though we of course welcome attendees who are not in the program to follow along for that portion of the session."
Kevin Griffin: Building Real Time Web Applications,01/11/2013,9:30 AM,10:30 AM,Salon H,Design/UX,"Welcome to Web 3.0.  Today, static web sites are considered boring and unhelpful to your users.  Do users need to constantly hit Refresh in order to pull the latest data your application has to offer?  Why not consider taking a real time approach to your web application.  In this session, we'll be guided through the development of a line of business application that attacks the real time problem head on.  In cases where up to date information is key for business decisions, you're doing yourself a disfavor by staying static.  Come learn how to build real time web applications!

The audience will have the following points to take away from the sessions:

- Understanding of what it means to build a real time web application
- Understanding of basic technology available to implement real time web applications
- Understanding of design considerations and techniques for building real time web applications.

Jared Faris: Building Rich User Experiences Without JavaScript Spaghetti,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Salon H,JavaScript,"Most Javascript is written to glue code and UI together without any thought to design patterns. Over time this leads to piles of Javascript that look nothing like code you’d be proud of writing. In this talk we’ll look at the rise of software libraries (like Knockout) that can help add structure to your JS. We’ll talk about when they help your project, and when they get in the way. We’ll also look into how you can easily use the Mediator and Observer patterns in JavaScript to really clean up your code with or without other libraries. As an added bonus we’ll talk about using Message Buses to really decouple your JavaScript controls. We'll compare this messaging approach to a shared models approach (like Backbone). I’ll explain how we’re using these patterns at Facio and how you can implement them in your code. At the end we'll look at some code samples and we'll talk about whatever other patterns you might be interested in doing in JavaScript."

"Sridhar Nanjundeswaran: Building, Deploying, and Scaling MongoDB (Tuesday Half Day PM)",01/08/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Other,"MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented database designed with scalability and developer agility in mind. MongoDB bridges the gap between key-value stores – which are fast and scalable – and relational databases – which have rich functionality. Instead of storing data in tables and rows as one would with a relational database, MongoDB stores JSON documents with dynamic schemas. This flexible data model makes it easy to use MongoDB and to adapt the database seamlessly as applications evolve.

This workshop will provide an overview of MongoDB and its core capabilities. Coming out of the workshop, participants will have the tools they need to begin developing on MongoDB. The first section, “Building your First App with MongoDB,” covers the basics of MongoDB's document-oriented model, query language, map-reduce framework and deployment architecture. Next, in “Schema Design and Indexing,” we will address how to best model your data with MongoDB. In the third session, “Intro. To Replication and Sharding,” we will introduce the basic concepts around replica sets and sharding, which provide for high availability and horizontal scalability. In the fourth and final session, “Deploying your MongoDB Application,” we will show you how to operationalize MongoDB and deploy it on-premise or in the cloud.

Bill Wagner: C# Async Programming Workshop (Wednesday Half Day AM),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,Orange,.NET,"Asynchronous programming is much more than using the async and await keywords. In this workshop, you'll build your asynchronous programming skills by writing asynchronous programs.  In addition to working with the new syntax, you'll learn what problems asynchronous programming addresses in both client and server environments. You'll learn to distinguish between threads and asynchronous models, and why Task.Wait is a code smell. You'll spend the rest of the workshop learning to program with Task<T> and TaskCompletionSource<T> in order to build your asynchronous toolbox. By the end of the session, you'll be productive using async idioms in C#."
"Jon Galloway: Camper Van Full of ASP.NET - Packing MVC, Web API, Web Forms, and More Into One App",01/10/2013,9:45 AM,10:45 AM,Sagewood/Zebrawood,.NET,"Okay, you've heard that ASP.NET is one big framework of love and kisses, right? And legos. But does it actually all work like that? Can we build one ASP.NET app using MVC, Web Forms, and Web API into one application? Will it kind of work but be a big ball of mud? Or a fearsomely beautiful hydra of untold power? Honestly, I don't know. Come along for the ride. Audience members sitting in the front three rows may be eaten. By the hydra. I mean, we just don't know, do we?"
Eric Hankinson: Cartography & Coupons - Introducing iOS6 Passbook & MapKit,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Salon A,Mac/iPhone,"Map Kit was introduced in iOS 5 to provide access to the Google Maps and Google Earth APIs. In iOS 6, Apple now provides their own maps, as well as an easier way to launch the Maps app and display points of interest. Apps that provide routing information can now register as a routing app and make those services available to the entire system. Passbook is a new technology in iOS 6 to implement support for downloadable passes. This can include coupons, boarding passes, event tickets and discount cards.

Learn how to provide and display directions from your iOS apps, as well as what is involved to leverage Pass Kit for your next app."
Dennis Burton: Choose Your Own Application - The Mystery of the Single-Page App (Tuesday Half Day PM),01/08/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,H,Other,"The relentless Page Refresh has been delivering its blinding white flash to your users and consuming valuable bandwidth for years. Does your team have the Backbone to Knockout the Page Refresh? You can engage the hubs of SignalR, broadcast with Socket.io, or maybe even Pusher. Will your server stack be up to the challenge? Wield frameworks like Node.js, ASP.NET MVC and WebAPI, or Rails. You will practice hours in the dojo of Heroku, and explore Azure skies to complete all of the paths in this adventure. Can you step outside of your comfort zone and mash some code? Are you up to the challenge?

In this session, you will embark on a “Choose Your Own Adventure”-style project where you will make decisions as you develop a Single-Page Application. You will make technology choices that include JavaScript or CoffeeScript, Backbone or Knockout, ASP.NET or Rails or Node.js, and Heroku or Azure. When you complete your adventure, you will have a fully-working application built with the technologies of your choosing. The best part is, you can keep coding and recoding until you have not one but many incredible implementations of the Single-Page Application.

Kevin Munc: CI for iOS: Do more while you sleep,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Salon A,Mac/iPhone,"Continuous Integration (CI) can boost your project up a notch. It can make your dev life easier. You may know this from having used a Continuous Integration server on Java, .NET or Ruby projects - it's pretty common, and for good reason. But CI for iOS is still too rare. This talk will discuss how to get started with CI for your iPhone and iPad projects. We'll cover compiling your code, running tests and deploying your app. We'll also survey other tools you can add to your CI environment to get more done while you sleep."

This time around the Client is JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the browser. The tools and deployment techniques for these types of applications are abundant and fragmented. This session will teach you how to pull together jQuery, LESS, Twitter Bootstrap, and some CoffeeScript to build the Client. The Server could be anything that talks HTTP but this session will use the Play Framework. You will also learn how to deploy Client/Server web apps on the cloud using a Content Delivery Network (Amazon CloudFront) for the Client and a Cloud Application Provider (Heroku) for the Server."

Evan Hauck: Compute Faster with the GPU in C#,01/10/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Guava/Tamarind,.NET,"We all know the GPU can be thousands of times faster than the CPU. Yet few of take the trouble to learn yet another obscure language just to gain a few clock ticks. If you think it would be nice if we could just write code in C# and have it run on the GPU, then this talk is for you. Join us as we write code from scratch to run on either the CPU or GPU. We will cover how to install and use Cudafy, pass data to and from the GPU and upload methods to run on the GPU’s massively parallel architecture. After this talk, the shroud of mystery preventing you from using the GPU will have been lifted."

Rob Gillen: Convenience vs. Security (Wednesday Half Day AM),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,Ironwood,Security,"Technology is great! It makes our life easier! More and more our devices seamlessly connect and things ""just work""… but sometimes there is a dark side to this functionality. What assumptions are made to enable the seamlessness that we crave? What tradeoffs are occurring that we might not even be aware of?
 
During this session Bill and Rob walk through a number of widely used technologies and platforms and discuss/demonstrate the weaknesses that are present in them. We begin by dealing with the ubiquitous WiFi and deal both with access point and client side attacks and weaknesses.  We then move on and demonstrate how easy it is to fall prey to phishing and spear phishing attacks.  For those of you who feel safe due to your exceptional computer practices and prowess - we talk about and demonstrate ""water cooler"" attacks.
 
This session ends by dealing with how to protect yourself once the bad guys are ""in"" (an assumption that the first part of the session will give you an appreciation for).  How do you keep your site's user info from being the next big thing on PasteBin? How do you keep your name out of the news? What best practices should you be implementing now to make yourself (and the platforms you are responsible for) more secure?

Ben Riga: Developing on Windows 8 (Tuesday Full Day) ,01/08/2013,8:30 AM,5:30 PM,Guava/Tamarind,Windows 8,"Windows 8 is Windows re-imagined, representing today’s single biggest opportunity for developers.  Join us for a Windows 8 app workshop to learn how you can take full advantage.  You'll learn from experts in a low-key, interactive way and then get hands-on time to apply what you’ve learned.

In this workshop you will gain an understanding of the platform design tenets, the programming language choices, and the integration points with the operating system and across Windows Store apps.  You'll learn the design principles behind the Windows Store apps and get insights into how to apply these principles in your own apps.  We'll cover updates to familiar .NET or Silverlight features and explore concepts that are new for Windows 8 and show you how to turn your XAML skills into money-making Windows Store apps.

Windows 8 provides a new ready-to-use set of user interface controls and we'll show you how to use them to implement the common patterns that deliver great Windows 8 Store apps.  We'll teach you how to design adaptive layouts that ensure that your apps look great across all different screen sizes, resolutions and aspect ratios
 
With Windows 8 you'll design your app with the expectation that touch will be the primary input method of your users. Support for mouse and pen/stylus requires no additional work as Windows 8 provides this for free. We'll teach you about the touch language and patterns as well as how to incorporate mouse, keyboard and pen. You’ll also learn about the techniques to use for direct manipulation, such as touch targets, layout, margins and use of app bars.
 
Your app's Tiles and Notifications keep it front and center increasing the connection with the user.  In this session we'll cover how you can include primary and secondary Tiles that are ""live"" encouraging the user to personalize their Start screen by pinning info from your app.
 
Windows Store apps use contracts to declare the interactions that they support with other apps.  We'll teach you how to design apps that implement contracts to attract new users or delight existing users by providing them seamless integration with other apps or the system."

Jonathan Small: Don't develop prototypes...Sketchflow them,01/10/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Salon H,Design/UX,In a world of knee jerk reactions by management and clients showing a working prototype can be a killer.  They either love the way it looks without thinking about its functionality or hate the way it looks without ever focusing on the functionality.  Either way they miss the goal that prototyping should accomplish.  In walks Sketchflow to save you.  This tool provides a great way to create a functional prototype while purposely avoiding the look/feel barrier.  It also provides a great way to send out the prototype to remote users and capture their feedback on a view by view basis.  We'll look at the basics of creating a Sketchflow prototype and also examine the tool for getting feedback.

James Kovacs: Emergent Architecture with TDD/BDD,01/11/2013,9:30 AM,10:30 AM,Portia/Wisteria,Testing,"As architects, we have all experienced the folly of BDUF (Big Design Up Front) – spending weeks or months perfecting an architecture that fails when it meets the real requirements and real code. Is it possible to design in the small? How can we avoid unintended complexity, which cripples so many code bases? Can we build enough of an architecture to start writing code and then flesh out our architecture as the code evolves? In this session we examine how Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) allow us to solve these conundrums. We will see how we can use TDD/BDD to focus our architectural efforts in the high-value areas of our code base to achieve just-in-time architecture."

Mike Swift: Full Stack Integration Tests with Node.js,01/11/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Rosewood,Testing,"Writing full-stack integration tests can be a time consuming and tedious process in any language.  As your application grows, your tests naturally should take longer and longer to run and become more difficult to maintain.  Using node you can actually dramatically increasing the speed of your tests and still achieve the same level of test coverage.  Specifically I'll show you how you can use Zombie.js or Phantom.js and Cucumber.js to perform integration tests on your application.  We'll also take a look at some useful tools for things like mock objects and JSON factories and some common pitfalls you can avoid."
"Jeremy Miller: Fully Operational FubuMVC 1.0 (Wednesday Half Day, PM)",01/09/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,Nile,.NET,"FubuMVC has quietly been in active use and development for a little over three years as a web development framework for .Net, but now it’s time for its full coming-out party.  Even if you’re perfectly happy with the framework your team uses, FubuMVC incorporates some ideas and features not found in today’s most popular frameworks such as Ruby on Rails or ASP.Net MVC.
We’ll start things off by showing how to start a minimalistic project with FubuMVC and do all the basic “Hello World” operations that every web framework does without breaking a sweat, but focus on how the FubuMVC “one model in, one model out” approach is different.  We’ll quickly follow that up by showing many of the features we believe are unique to FubuMVC like composable Html conventions, Url resolution logic, integrated authorization, and “meta-conventions.” 
FubuMVC relies very heavily on conventions for developer productivity as opposed to explicit directives like a Sinatra-flavored tool or higher ceremony tools like ASP.Net MVC.  We strongly prefer that approach because of how clean the code becomes, but that kind of “black magic” can easily cause just as much harm as good.  Fortunately the FubuMVC team has made a deep investment in diagnostics to explain the conventions that are active in your system, how they impact the behavior of your system, and full runtime tracing to visualize how an http request is handled by the various runtime parts of your FubuMVC application.  We’ll show you how to use the FubuMVC.Diagnostics package to understand and troubleshoot problems with your FubuMVC project.
FubuMVC supports a very rich modularity story using the related Bottles library and a relentless focus on composing code in an “open/closed” fashion.  In this session we’ll quickly assemble a simple application by dropping in several off the shelf Bottles to handle infrastructure concerns like authentication and validation and even simplify usage of JavaScript assets like Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery.UI.  We’ll also show you how to build your own Bottles – both for reusable infrastructure concerns and how to isolate features into their own Bottle projects to facilitate Continuous Deployment strategies.
FubuMVC also comes with a very powerful asset pipeline to fully control script and stylesheet loading, dependencies between assets, caching policies, and a transformation pipeline for minification, combining assets, and using languages like CoffeeScript, LeSS, and Sass.  We’ll show you how to use the asset pipeline in development and talk about the steps we’ve taken to improve performance and smooth out the development process.  We’ll also show you how to incorporate Html templates generated on the server as assets for “Single Page Application” style development.
Time permitting, we’ll also show how we do automated testing against FubuMVC applications at the unit test, integration testing with the Kayak web server, and acceptance testing using WebDriver.

You get to 100% code coverage, but when you finally deploy your application, the system is broken! How can we have full code coverage, but our application still breaks?
In this session, we'll look at functional testing with ASP.NET MVC and how we can design our system for testability. We'll also look at how we can write functional tests that don't break easily, and see how we can finally ditch the test recorders.

Joshua Smith: Go! Go! Go-lang Awesome!,01/11/2013,9:30 AM,10:30 AM,Cypress,Other Languages,"The Go language was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Systems programming had become difficult and the languages available were a big part of the problem. You could choose ease with Python or efficiency with C++ or safety with Java.  None of the choices could address all concerns.

Enter (Rob Pike's Masterwork) the language Go. Go is the space-based I-have-come-from-the-future-to-save-you tactical nuclear smasher-of-evil you have been waiting for. it is a modern language with support for advanced networking, multicore computing, excellent string handling and portability.

No previous experience with Go is required for this introductory talk."
Mike Eaton: Going Independent (Tuesday Full Day),01/08/2013,8:30 AM,5:30 PM,Ironwood,Other,"Breaking free from the confines of the cubicle farm and going out on your own can be one of the most satisfying things you do for your career. It can also be one of the most terrifying. Being on your own can seem like it's nothing but ponies, unicorns and rainbows, but it's a lot of work, and success is not guaranteed.

Mike, an independent developer since 2001, will discuss the lessons he's learned over the years along with the ups and downs he's experienced. In this updated and expanded session, he will be joined by two legal professionals to help answer the most common questions he's been asked over the years.

Indeed, there aren't any websites out there like that, but we’ll arm you with some tools to change them should you ever encounter the rare case...
The morning session will be all JavaScript, all the time. We'll start by delving into the dark corners of the language, examining the syntax, common practical patterns, and other idiosyncrasies. After our intro to Javascript we'll work on our example app, and turn ""pretty good"" JavaScript into code that displays separation of concerns and code that is easily testable. We'll use Backbone.js, the Underscore.js tools included with Backbone.js, and the Jasmine testing framework to treat your client-side code like a first class citizen without overhauling your existing application.
The afternoon session will introduce CoffeeScript to those who haven't had much exposure to it. CoffeeScript is a language that complies into JavaScript, and it is baked into newer versions of Ruby on Rails. We'll show some of the syntax and patterns, and we'll explain why someone would want to use it over plain, boring JavaScript. After we get familiar with CoffeeScript, we'll hit the reset button on our example app from the morning session and once again set to refactoring it to be clean, beautiful, well tested code with Backbone.js, but do it all in CoffeeScript this time.

Using HTML5 along with JavaScript and CSS3, Microsoft has enabled web developers from all platforms the ability to start app dev with a very low learning curve. Come see what that learning curve looks like, as Greg discusses what WinJS is and how to use it. You will learn about the basics of Windows Store App patterns, navigation, async, and operating system integration."
David Giard: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love jQuery,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Salon D,JavaScript,"JavaScript is an excellent way to add rich client-side functionality to a web site. But differences in the DOM implementation by the various browsers and platforms can make JavaScript difficult. JQuery solves this by providing a library of functions that provide simplified, consistent, cross-browser, cross-platform JavaScript support.
In this session, I will show how to add jQuery to your applications and use it to add rich functionality to your web sites. 
This presentation is heavy on examples, showing jQuery syntax and functionality; showing Ajax calls with jQuery; and showing jQuery UI examples.

Jamie Begin: How to Build Resilient & Scalable PHP Applications on Amazon Web Services,01/10/2013,9:45 AM,10:45 AM,Rosewood,PHP,"Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a deceptively simple method of building PHP apps in the cloud.  However, AWS is fundamentally different from traditional hosting environments in a number of important ways.  Jamie and Mike from RightBrain Networks will be discussing best practices, common mistakes, and cost-saving strategies every PHP developer using AWS should know. Included will be lessons learned and architecture examples from real-life deployments."
Jon Skeet: How to make the C# Compiler (or Team) Cry,01/10/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Guava/Tamarind,.NET,"C# is a wonderfully powerful language, with each new release bringing new shiny toys for developers. Normally we would only use these features for honorable purposes, but... well, it's fun to abuse languages occasionally. I've rarely met a language feature I haven't found some way of twisting in weird and wonderful ways.

I will do my utmost to make sure that absolutely none of the code presented in this talk will be suitable for production use, but that all of it will be entertaining and possibly eye-watering. Let's face it, you didn't really come to CodeMash to learn, did you?

Benjamin Winkler: How to Start a Company,01/10/2013,9:45 AM,10:45 AM,Nile,Business,"Got a great idea?  Setting up something on the side with a couple coworkers?  Great!  Now what?  Should you sign something about who has ownership?  What exactly is an LLC or an EIN?  Is the text message from your client okaying the project cost good enough?  What about that guy who dropped out early on?  This session explores the legal nuts and bolts of how to go into business - how to establish a business entity, what you agree on now to avoid litigation later, when to get a lawyer involved in dealing with a customer, and why you should never, ever agree with your friends that you are ""partners""."
Frederic Simon: How we Took Our Server-side Application to the Cloud and Liked What We Got,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Rosewood,Java," Taking traditional Java server-side applications to the multi-tenant Cloud introduces lots of challenges. In this session, we will share our experience of creating a SaaS offering, which is currently being used successfully by the Java community. We will start by reviewing the challenges we faced during the SaaS conversion. Next, we will share our experience with the EC2 platform. We will discuss the importance of automation and how we use tools like Chef and Puppet for SaaS provisioning. Finally, we will describe how creating a SaaS version of our product shifted our way of thinking about software release. We will recommend what’s required to successfully release both SaaS and downloadable versions of your product."
Andrew Glover: HTML 5 and the Great Mobile Debate,01/10/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Zambezi,Mobile,"A year ago, hybrid development frameworks like PhoneGap that leverage HTML5 were poised to radically alter mobile app development.  A year later, the potential has failed to live up to the promise: Faster/Easier/Cheaper doesn't always mean Better. Going Native often times still remains the best way to go. And Native doesn't have to mean Objective-C or Java -- there's a bevy of innovative mobile development frameworks gaining momentum that ultimately produce a legitimate native application that doesn't suffer from an underwhelming user experience associated with poorly built mobile web apps. What's more, in this stage of mobile's evolution, multi-platform doesn't always have to be a requirement. What is a primary requirement, however, is U/X and this is where HTML5 lacks Native parity. 

In this presentation, I'll address the Great Mobile Debate head-on -- you'll learn the current state of HTML 5 and understand what's good about it and what isn't. I'll show you where HTML 5 makes sense and how to leverage it correctly, and then I'll demonstrate an impressive list of mobile development frameworks that enable you to build awesome Native apps that consumers demand. And these frameworks don't demand mastery of Objective-C or Java -- like PhoneGap they abstract the raw platform, but unlike PhoneGap, they ultimately build an app capable of wowing an end user.

Brandon Satrom: HTML5 Workshop (Wednesday Half Day AM),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,Zambezi,Web,"HTML5 is exciting, and it does have the potential to change the Web as we know it, but it also gets blown out of proportion. What’s more, its true meaning can be elusive. It’s a broad topic, so it’s difficult to wrap your head around HTML5, much less know where to begin with this exciting new set of technologies. 
  
That's where our pre-compiler comes in. 
  
Over the course of a half-day, we (Brandon Satrom and Clark Sell) will tell you everything you need to know to get started with the next generation of open web technologies. We'll start with an overview of what HTML5 is, and why it matters, before moving quickly through major aspects of the core HTML5 specifications. Then, we'll discuss highlights of CSS3, major new JavaScript APIs and language features, before we end with a discussion on graceful degradation and adopting HTML5 without leaving older browsers behind.  Throughout the day, we'll mix in hands-on exercises and labs so that you can leave with a working understanding of these technologies, and how you can begin to apply them immediately. This session is platform agnostic, so all you need to attend get your hands dirty is a text editor (like TextMate, Vim, e, Visual Studio or WebMatrix) and your favorite, modern browser to learn how to make the web shine."
Justine Arreche: I Am Designer and So Can You!,01/10/2013,4:50 PM,5:50 PM,Salon H,Design/UX,"For many developers, design does not come naturally. Lucky for you, you have ME! (Congrats on your recent acquisition of my friendship and knowledge.) Let me be the first to tell you design isn’t as complicated as it may seem. It all boils down to three basic strategies that we’ll discuss in this session.

First, we’ll go over the fundamentals of grid structure. This will include how to set the content to maximize space allowance, and create an appropriate hierarchy to convey your content based on importance. Second, we’ll take a brief trip down color-theory lane. Theory? Yes, there is theory behind all UI color choices and you’ll learn what that means and why. Last, get ready, this is the big finale; we’re going to talk type! Type is a huge part of design and is often neglected or simply thought of as the alphabet. Each typeface tells a story and you want to make sure you’re picking one that’s right for your message.

If all of this sounds over your head, fear not, I’ll hold your hand and go slow. This session is for design beginners, people who have an interest in design, or just those of you who’d like to be able to understand your own designers better."
David Hoerster: I Didn't Know JavaScript Could Do That! The Missing Introduction to the World's Most Misunderstood Language,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Salon D,JavaScript,"JavaScript used to be a language that most ASP.NET developers shied away from, or only used it for some simple form validation. With the ascent of jQuery, developers are realizing that JavaScript is more than just a way to validate data or perform some simple functions. It's a powerful language that is quickly becoming the engine driving most web applications. But for most developers, their exposure is limited to using JavaScript through frameworks, such as jQuery, and they really haven't been exposed to the true power of JavaScript.

In this session, we'll learn about some features of JavaScript that you may not be familiar with. From the concepts of truthy and falsey, to extending your objects through prototypal inheritence (and properly exposing your object's functions), we'll take a tour through the JavaScript language that will make you say ""I Didn't Know JavaScript Could Do That!"".

Chris Gardner: Intermediate Xbox 360 Development with the XNA Framework,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Indigo Bay,Game Development,"The methods for producing quality games that perform in real time are much different than the methods used to produce quality productivity software. Sure, you've slapped some sprites on the screen, but do you have the tools to turn those sprites into a full experience. This session will present attendees with the nuances of proper game design by introducing topics such as the game components, sprite animation, background music, sound effects, and threading."
Rob Gillen: Into the Mind of a Hacker. (Wednesday Half Day PM),01/09/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,Ironwood,Security,"In this session Bill and Rob dig deep into the world of exploits and malware with a specific emphasis on explaining the process by which these tools are created and reverse engineered. This is a step well beyond running ""exploit"" from within msfconsole and attendees should expect to see a fair bit of assembly and register-level debugging.
 
The purpose of this session is not to build an army of cyber miscreants but rather to help you understand how attackers look at your software, and the types of things they are looking to exploit. You will leave this session with a better idea of how you can protect your applications from being an unknown carrier of the next bit of malware to sweep the 'Net.
 
This session starts with a demonstration of crafting an exploit (identifying a weakness, testing for specific vulnerabilities, execution and ""weaponization"").  We then dig into the internals of Windows and arm you with the tools and understanding to begin working through an exploited machine and understanding what the malware has been doing on the infected system.

It turns out that all of your delays have really paid off. This is the perfect time to get started writing apps for iPhone and iPad. The tools, the language, and the platform has matured.

In this session we'll take a brief look at the four cornerstones of developing for the iOS platform. You'll take a quick look at Xcode, the IDE for creating your apps, and Objective-C, the language for iOS development. We'll then take a brief tour of View Controllers, the anchors of any Cocoa Touch application, and storyboards. "
Daniel Steinberg: iOS 6 Quick Start (Wednesday Half Day AM),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,Aloeswood/Lepoardwood,iOS,"You'll learn what it takes to write an iPhone or iPad app in the few hours between breakfast and lunch.

The first half of this hands-on session will get you started creating projects in Xcode and working with the basics of Objective-C. After the break we'll play with the patterns of iOS development for getting the most out of View Controllers and storyboards. Our goal with this session is to give you a sense of what iOS development is all about. Once you're done you can go to the books, the tutorials, and the Apple docs to build the apps you want.

If you want to code along with us, you'll need to bring a Mac running at least OS X 10.7 Lion but preferably OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Download and install the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store. Also, you'll be happier if you download the documentation from Xcode's preferences pane.

Other Amazon Web Services will be demonstrated and discussed as appropriate.

Note: An Amazon Web Services Account is a nice to have and will incur a minimal cost during the tutorial but is not a requirement. Access to AWS will be provided to you if you don’t already have access."
Charles Oliver Nutter: JVM Bytecode for Dummies,01/10/2013,9:45 AM,10:45 AM,Orange,Java,"You've written applications for the JVM, using various frameworks and maybe even various languages. You understand how to rig up the CLASSPATH, get .class files to load, compile source, and set up an IDE. But you've always wanted a better understanding of the plumbing underneath. How does JVM bytecode work? How does the JVM itself work? This tallk will walk you through JVM and JVM bytecode basics, with lots of examples how to subvert the JVM to your whims."
Charles Oliver Nutter: JVM JIT for Dummies,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Orange,Java,"You think you know all there is about building apps for the JVM. You've used all the cool tools. You've written your own persistence library or web frameworks. Maybe you've even implemented a JVM language. But do you really know what happens to your code after you hand it off to the JVM?

Todd Kaufman: Lean and Mean Domain Objects in Active Record (Tuesday Half Day AM),01/08/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Ruby,"Rails apps that have been extensively enhanced and maintained over the last few years are starting to fall apart under their own weight. Developers have struggled trying to find the most appropriate area to place logic within the system. Initially the ease of writing views in ERB led many developers to stow code at the front of the application. Then we began finding the views to difficult to maintain so we moved the logic into controllers or helpers. Eventually this also became difficult to maintain so we developed ""best practices"" like skinny controllers and fat models. Active Record domain models naturally become the dumping ground of logic within the system but sooner or later this leads to brittle, unmaintainable, bug filled systems.
Coupling persistence, validation, advanced querying, and business logic all into the same class inevitably leads to extremely fat models with any system of significance. Skinny controllers are definitely worth striving for, but shoveling all of the business logic into a class that is already overburdened with with three other concerns is a recipe for disaster. When you find yourself using factories, fixtures, or mocks to construct 8 different class dependencies, it's time to admit that fat models are not a solution worth aspiring to.
This talk will cover some different approaches for segregating the multiple concerns of fat Active Record models into loosely coupled, cohesive classes with single responsibilities. We'll dive into the both the process for refactoring these plump classes along with some better patterns of use for common AR bloat.

As one of the earlier shops to embrace it, we've learned a lot about how to use it more effectively over time.  We'll start with introducing backbone.js to catch everybody up that hasn't used it, but spend most of this session digging in a little deeper to cover topics like composite views, model relationships, error response handling, memory management, just to name a few. Expect to get a lot of out of this talk if you're new to backbone or even if you've been using it for awhile."

Additionally, classification (or predictive inference) is only half of what machine learning has to offer. Unsupervised learning, as a discipline, incorporates many non-predictive principles that allow for the condensing of large amounts of data in a structured and predictable way. The purpose of this session is to demystify the central ideas behind pattern recognition and machine learning by demonstrating the fundamental concepts behind classification. Most developers shy away from such algorithms simply because of their perceived difficulty while missing the inherent simplicity of these approaches. This session will demonstrate how a computer can learn from labeled examples in order to predict appropriate labels for future examples.

The session will highlight Decision Trees, the Perceptron Algorithm, and introduce attendees to non-linear classifiers through the standard Kernel Trick. This friendly introduction will allow attendees to begin using these standard algorithms to create predictive software without the hassle of having to write difficult code.

"Jeremy Miller: Making Test Automation with Web Applications Work (Wednesday Half Day, AM)",01/09/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,Nile,Testing,"In a perfect world we would have automated test coverage for every significant part of our web applications that consistently provides quick and useful regression feedback.  In the real world automated testing efforts frequently fail because the tests are too time-consuming to author, too brittle when the underlying application changes, too flaky with asynchronous timing, or just flat out too slow.  After way too much teeth gnashing and a lot of struggling, I think my team has hit on a workable formula for successful test automation.  I’ll share our lessons learned about which tests are worth writing and which aren’t, balancing cheaper whitebox tests versus more comprehensive blackbox testing, and how to express the test scenarios to promote readability and minimize coupling.  I’ll show you some relatively simple strategies for dealing with asynchronous screen behavior.  I’ll demonstrate the approach we use to make setting up test data as declarative as possible while trying to decouple the test scenarios from being coupled to the application internals.  Lastly, I’ll talk about the application architecture choices you can make to reduce the effort to reward ration of your automated testing effort. 
My previous team used StoryTeller, WebDriver, Jasmine, and TeamCity to create and execute our automated tests, but I believe that these techniques are applicable to other tools like Cucumber, SpecFlow,m or WatiN/Watir as well.

Dan Shultz: Mastering ActiveRecord Scopes and Active Relationship,01/11/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Cypress,Ruby,"Most Rails developers only tap the surface of what ActiveRecord provides and never utilize the power of ActiveRelationship (ARel). ActiveRecord allows you to mix and match scopes in addition to merge scopes from related models to prevent duplication and provide great flexibility in composing your data. Additionally, you can leverage ActiveRelationship to write complex joins, selects, aggregations and even unions which can also be merged as scopes to cleanly build queries. This talk will teach you how you can use ActiveRecord and ActiveRelationship together in order to build flexible and powerful sql queries without actually ever writing a line of raw sql."

Gary Short: Not Everything is an Object: Functional Superiority with Clojure,01/10/2013,4:50 PM,5:50 PM,Orange,Clojure,"We all know the saying that when your only tool is a hammer then every problem looks like Justin Bieber's face. If your only tool is an OO language then you start to force every solution domain into fitting the standard OO solution domain. This is flawed thinking and leads to broken or brittle software. In this session I'll show you that not every problem is well suited to an OO solution and what other solutions are available to you, with examples in Clojure."

Joshua Smith: NSPredicates for Fun and Profit,01/10/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Salon A,Mac/iPhone,"NSPredicates aren’t just for Core Data. NSPredicates are part of the
Foundation classes and can be used with collections in ways that make
your code more testable and easier to maintain. They are, however not
well documented and notoriously difficult to create. Sure, once
created they are easy to use and let you do things that are very
difficult without them. In this intermediate session we will cover
what NSPredicates are, where they can be used, how to debug them, and
how to replace difficult to maintain iterative code with elegant
predicates. You should have a good understanding of Objective C and
the collections. While we will cover some of Core Data, this is not a
Core Data session."
Chris Adamson: Objective-C Is Not Java,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Salon A,Mac/iPhone,"Look past the square braces and the damned header files and Objective-C -- the essential language of iOS development -- really isn't that different from other object-oriented languages. Classes, single-inheritance, polymorphism, implementation hiding... check, check, check, and check. So it's really not that difficult for old Java / Python / Ruby / C++ dogs to learn new tricks once they install Xcode, right?
To be a competent Obj-C programmer, not that hard.
To be a great Obj-C programmer... now that's another story.
In this session, we will look at traits that are unique to Objective-C, the tricks that bring out the expressiveness and power of the language. We'll also look at how to write idiomatic code that will be easily understood and maintained by other Objective-C developers. We'll look at how Automatic Reference Counting resembles but is really nothing like Garbage Collection, how properties put plain old instance variables to shame, how we loosely couple classes with delegates and notification, how blocks help us un-block our code by simplifying asynchronicity, and more."

You will learn how to handle schema migrations, maintain dev/prod parity, manage configuration and scaling."
Bryan Reinero: Processing Big Data with MongoDB,01/11/2013,9:30 AM,10:30 AM,Rosewood,Other,"An introduction to MongoDB’s tools to technologies to efficiently process large quantities of data. Topics include:

Map-Reduce Useful for batch processing of data and aggregation operations. It is similar in spirit to Hadoop with all input coming from a collection and output going to a collection. Map and reduce functions are written in JavaScript and execute on the server.

The Aggregation Framework is an alternate to Map-Reduce while providing a powerful means to calculate aggregate values. The aggregation framework can be used to perform SQL-like group-bys, distincts and self-joins. The aggregation framework also provides projection facilities which reshape data, add computed fields, create virtual sub-objects, and to extract sub-fields to results.

Hadoop Integration is a series of plugins for the Hadoop platform to allow connectivity to MongoDB The Hadoop connector allows both reading MongoDB data into Hadoop (for use in MapReduce jobs as well as other components of the Hadoop ecosystem), as well as writing the results of Hadoop jobs out to MongoDB."
Eric Hankinson: Puppet for Developers,01/10/2013,9:45 AM,10:45 AM,Salon E,Other Languages,"Puppet is a configuration management tool that allows easy and automated provisioning of servers by describing the packages, configuration, and system services. Along with continuous integration tools like Jenkins, it is a means to accomplishing continuous delivery, automating the operations side, and enabling testing of systems configuration. While systems provisioning is traditionally for system administrators, Puppet can empower developers. When combining Vagrant with Puppet, developers can easily spin up virtual machines with the same configuration as production servers to do development or testing, and tear them down afterwards.

You will see how to install and manage Puppet nodes with installed web and database servers, config files, and all the supporting services. Learn how Puppet can provision Vagrant and VirtualBox for application and infrastructure testing. You'll also learn how to write your own custom Facts as well as how to test your Puppet manifests with RSpec."
Gary Fredericks: Put Some Parentheses in your Browser: an introduction to ClojureScript,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Orange,Clojure,"ClojureScript is a new dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript. We will discuss why you should consider using it over existing JavaScript languages like CoffeeScript, and cover build tools, web development libraries, how to use existing JavaScript libraries, and sharing code with the JVM."
Guy Royse: Putting the D&D in TDD (Wednesday All Day),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,5:30 PM,A,Other,"Are you tired of TDD workshops that make you do boring things like calculate bowling scores and prime factors or demonstrate how to win at the game of life? If so, this is the session for you! In this TDD workshop we will be building the domain model for EverCraft -- a new MMORPG from Blizzards of the Coast.  We have lots of story cards prepared covering features from combat to magic, classes to spells, and races to items. Plus, we'll be defining some of these cards during the session in case you want that +9 knife of ogre slaying or enjoy casting magic missile at the darkness. 

This workshop is language agnotisic and for all levels of developers. The focus is on TDD and emergent design but pair programming will be covered as well. The only requirement is that you bring a laptop and that you be able to test-drive you code with your language of choice.  When you are done you will emerge a better programmer for the experience but there is small chance you will have a craving for Cheetos and Mountain Dew."
Mark Greenway: Putting your Backbone Apps on strings : Backbone Marionette and its Lessons about Backbone,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Salon D,JavaScript,"Backbone is one of the top MVC frameworks for JavaScript.  Backbone Marionette is an open source project that takes backbone makes it fast and easy.  I will take popular backbone patterns and show how quickly and efficiently they can be done with marionette.  From collection views to event handling, this talk will show you how to create better JavaScript front ends than you have made before.  The talk will explain how Marionette is coded and operates, so that even if you don’t use it you can take back the techniques to your JavaScript code."
Jason Follas: Quantum Entanglement for your Web Apps using SignalR and Knockout ,01/10/2013,4:50 PM,5:50 PM,Aloeswood/Leopardswood,JavaScript,"In physics, two particles can act together in order to behave as one system so that a change made to one particle instantly affects the other - even if they are separated by great distances. This is known as Quantum Entanglement, which Albert Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance."" The closest analogy to this for web development would be to observe a web page instantly update in response to a user entering data in a different web browser. Believe it or not, this is not only possible today, but relatively easy by using two open source libraries together: SignalR and Knockout. SignalR is an asynchronous signaling library for .NET that helps to build real-time, multi-user systems. Knockout is a JavaScript library that brings MVVM pattern to the web page, providing observable data, templates, and automatic data binding. This session will demonstrate how to use this new paradigm to build highly interactive web applications."
Jamie Wright: Rails for the .NET Developer,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Cypress,Ruby,"""You live a new life for every new language you speak. If you know only one language, you live only once."" -- Czech proverb
It's good to learn new languages and environments. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and identify the right tool for the right job.
As someone who has spent the last few years using both environments on a daily basis, we will compare and contrast web development in the Microsoft .NET world vs. web development using the Ruby on Rails stack. We will compare the languages, the tooling, the communities, and the frameworks. This session will help the .NET developer get started down the Rails rabbit hole."
"Rick Copeland: Rapid and Scalable Development with MongoDB, PyMongo, and Ming",01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Cypress,Python,"This intermediate-level talk will teach you techniques using the popular NoSQL database MongoDB and the Python library Ming to write maintainable, high-performance, and scalable applications. We will cover everything you need to become an effective Ming/MongoDB developer from basic PyMongo queries to high-level object-document mapping setups in Ming."
Gary Short: Raspberry Pi Deep Dive,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Salon G,Hardware,The Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized computer developed by some Cambridge boffins. In this session I'll walk you through everything you need to do get up and running with it and then show you how to turn it into an Internet radio using Mono C# and VistaDB.
Keith Burnell: Reach the Mobile Masses with ASP.NET MVC 4 and jQuery Mobile,01/10/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Rosewood,.NET,"Creating web applications that will target multiple devices and platforms has become the web developers Holy Grail. Simple HTML pages render without issue no matter what browser or device they are viewed on but who codes simple HTML pages? What happens when you have a business need to hit all mobile platforms?
You don't have to write hundreds of lines of code to make this happen! 
	
In this talk Keith will demonstrate how using the latest version of ASP.NET MVC, MVC4, and jQuery Mobile allows you to develop web applications that target iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone 7, and even Blackberry without having to code and style each platform separately.

Alexei Govorine: Realizing Agility with Scrum and Visual Studio 2012 (Tuesday All Day),01/08/2013,8:30 AM,5:30 PM,A,Process,"This full-day pre-compiler introduces the Scrum framework and the supporting tools found in Visual Studio. Attendees will get a crash course in Scrum and if you are already experienced in Scrum, never fear! We’ll provide value in the form of refinements and effective practices you can take back to your teams. 

After laying down a solid Scrum framework foundation, we’ll explore features in Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server 2012 that specifically target increasing productivity for Scrum Teams. Features and techniques to enable collaboration, increase quality, and increase your Definition of Done will all be visited.

This workshop is a healthy mix of both the people side of Agile and the engineering practices that enable value-focused interactive/incremental development."
Justin Searls: Real-world JavaScript Testing (Wednesday Half Day PM),01/09/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,Zambezi,JavaScript,"Each year, more applications are being written for the browser entirely in JavaScript. If you're interested in taking front-end web technologies more seriously, then consider investing the time in this workshop.

This PreCompiler will be much more than a pedestrian review of information you could easily glean from a README or a written tutorial. Instead, attendees will be given opinionated, hands-on tour of how the presenters actually write code at their day jobs. That means we'll introduce the ""vanilla"" Jasmine API, but we'll quickly pivot to a workflow that we believe is even better; with tools like jasmine-fixture, jasmine-stealth, jasmine-given, and CoffeeScript. 

The workshop will be punctuated by a number of pair-programming labs: starting with a basic test-driven-development exercise, moving onto testing more complex object interactions, and graduating to AJAX and DOM manipulation situations that in a real web application.

Rob Tarr: Responsive JavaScript: Not Your Momma's JS,01/10/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Salon D,JavaScript,"Responsive Web Design (RWD) is all the rage. As the industry explores the patterns and design challenges of RWD, we need to examine the ways in which we write the JavaScript that powers the interactions. RWD has also presented some design challenges that CSS alone isn't ready for. We'll take a look at some of the leading JavaScript solutions to solve some of these problems as well as some of the problems that have still need solutions."
Bruce Eckel: Rethinking Errors: Learning from Scala and Go,01/10/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Sagewood/Zebrawood,Other,"C++ brought exceptions to mainstream programming, and Java goes further with checked exceptions. Both languages treat exceptions as the one way to report all kinds of errors. The Scala and Go languages introduce a new idea: There is more than one kind of error. Thus, there should be more than one kind of error reporting, and multiple different kinds of responses to errors. I’ll show some of the history and past experiments in error handling, then look at how Scala and Go approach the error problem in a better way."
Bill Sempf: Riding the Metro: Real World Stories from the Trenches,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Aloeswood/Leopardswood,Windows 8,"If you are planning a Windows 8 app, you might want to hear from the trenches. Bill has been working full time on Windows Store apps and writing a book on programming Windows 8 for over a year. Come hear what he has learned about using Windows 8 every day as a development environment, coding in JavaScript for the desktop, async programming in a single threaded language, interacting with Windows 8 programmatically, and more."
Matt Barcomb: Rounding out whole-team quality through exploration (Tuesday Half Day AM),01/08/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,H,Testing,"Do you ever get a creeping feeling there is more to software quality than test automation and clean code? Have you wondered about broader quality considerations beyond testing the specification? Have you tried to use smoke testing or ad-hoc testing to better inform quality issues, but don't get the results you're looking for? If so, this session can help by providing a refreshing aromatic blend of Exploratory Testing and visualization techniques your team can use instantly!
 
In this session you will learn a handful of light-weight practical approaches to round out your teams' quality wheelhouse. First, we will create a product quality strategy that will help guide your quality activities. Next, we will discuss Structured Exploratory Testing and practice creating charters to help inform on various aspects of quality. Finally, we will review some simple techniques for visualizing quality activities and enhance a team's workflow."
Steve Klabnik: Ruby for (Possible) Converts (Wednesday Half Day AM),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,12:30 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Ruby,"
Are you experienced in a language like C/C++/C# or Java? Are you a little Ruby-curious? This session is for you.

We'll start with a quick introduction to fundamental Ruby syntax and patterns, get you started on a project, then turn you loose to practice and discover.

Please note that this session is focusing on pure Ruby and will not dive into Rails.
"
Steve Klabnik: Ruby Style and Object-Oriented Programming (Wednesday Half Day PM),01/09/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Ruby,"Ruby has a cute syntax and a rich set of libraries -- but neither is useful in the long run without and understanding of how to design Ruby objects. What does a good method look like? When should you use codules instead of classes? How do you take advantage of blocks?
Optional parameters? Duck typing?

If you are familiar with the basis of Ruby syntax, this session can help take your design to the next level. We'll pursue a solution to a simple project while emphasizing the design of modules, classes, methods and lines of code. We'll look at a few methods for abstraction and refactoring, especially focusing on techniques that show off Ruby's more unusual capabilities and patterns.

Please note that this session is focusing on pure Ruby and will not dive into Rails.

Jonathan Penn: RubyMotion for iOS,01/11/2013,9:30 AM,10:30 AM,Salon A,Mac/iPhone,"RubyMotion is a brand new project built by the creator of MacRuby that finally brings the power of native Ruby application development to iOS. RubyMotion gives you a way to quickly bootstrap, compile, deploy code written in Ruby that accesses all the raw power of the Cocoa Touch and Core Foundation APIs.

Under the hood, Objective C shares a lot in common with RubyMotion. It's not a translated bridge. The Ruby object model is built right on top of the Objective C runtime. We'll explore how it works, get a taste of its flexibility, see some demos in action, and talk about the pitfalls that await the brave souls who live on the cutting edge."
Bruce Eckel: Scala as a Better Java,01/11/2013,9:30 AM,10:30 AM,Orange,Scala,"One of the major C++ design goals was to bring C programmers into a world of better programming by allowing them to primarily program in what they know (C), and add C++ features as they learn them. This way, C++ got “the camel’s nose inside the tent” (and the rest of it eventually followed). This presentation will emphasize the advantages of “Programming Java in Scala” by translating selected examples from Thinking in Java 4th Edition. You’ll learn how you can make your Java life much better by coding in Scala."
Brandon Satrom: Secrets of Awesome JavaScript API Design,01/10/2013,4:50 PM,5:50 PM,Nile,JavaScript,"It doesn't take long for most developers to sniff out a poorly-designed JavaScript API. Within minutes of reading about or coding against a new library, most developers can intuit whether their long-term relationship with that library will be a pleasant or unfortunate one. While documentation, buzz and other factors certainly play into that conclusion, the largest influencer of that snap conclusion is the ""feel"" of the API itself. APIs are developer UX: A good one raises a developers enjoyment; a bad one sends it plummeting. 

As developers, we know what good and bad JavaScript APIs ""feel"" like, and yet we struggle with designing the kind of APIs that we enjoy using. But principles of good JavaScript API design do exist, and it's possible to extract them from several key libraries in the the proliferating JavaScript landscape. In this session, Brandon Satrom will do exactly that, digging into the design aspects of popular libraries like jQuery, Backbone, Knockout, Modernizer, Kendo UI and others to enumerate the designed-in qualities of these libraries that make them not only popular, but a pleasure to use."
Attila Domokos: Simple and Beautiful Rails Code with Functional Style,01/11/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Cypress,Ruby,"Do you have to look at Rails models with 1400 lines of code? Or 80 line method loaded with iterators, conditionals and instance variables? Not only you, even the code author does not understand what's going on in there.

I'll show you how you can craft simple and beautiful Rails application by adopting functional programming inspired ideas. Say goodbye to the mess you have by constructing tiny classes and functions that you can use to build up a complex system."

Jen Myers: Straight-Up Design: Simple Ways for Devs to Make Apps Look and Work Better,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Salon H,Design/UX,"It’s a question that designers in the coding world hear all the time from developers: “How do I make my stuff look better on my own?” It’s all very well and good to learn about design theory, but sometimes  - such as on side projects with no design support, or when you want to work more comfortably and fluidly with your company’s internal designers - you just want to know exactly what to do to polish your applications. We’ll discuss topics like finding good design inspiration, choosing fonts and colors, understanding visual hierarchy and messaging, improving overall user experience, and what frameworks and tools exist to help make your design work easier.

(This is more or less the “sequel” to the “Developers Can’t Design (And Other Completely Untrue Design Myths)” presented last year at Codemash.)"
Dick Wall: Subcut: Simple Injection Dependency Framework in Scala,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Orange,Scala,"About a year ago SubCut 1.0 was released and offered the simplest API for Scala dependency management that I could think of. It provides a DSL for easy configuration and binding of implementations to traits, a mixin trait for easy dependency lookup and injection, use of either mixins or implicit parameters to apply configuration to new instances, and an optional compiler plugin to remove the small amount of repeated boilerplate that showed up through the code when using implicit parameters.

To my surprise and great pleasure, people started to use SubCut - it scratched an itch with other people than just me. I also got committers on the project in github, and some fantastic improvements were submitted. During the same period, I and others continued to use SubCut and found some functional limitations in the current implementation. These things prompted work on a 2.0 release of subcut which has made a number of improvements to the API and functionality.

This session will cover what SubCut is and how it works, what is new in 2.0, and a more general look at working backwards from a desired API which emphasizes simplicity, an approach which is sometimes overlooked in the creation of Scala APIs."
Lwin Maung: Taking the Microcontrollers to the Next Level - Make Your Very Own PCB circuit board,01/10/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Salon G,Hardware,"What do you think two geeks do when they have too much time on their hands? They have fun with microcontrollers. In this session, Min and Lwin will start off with basics on electronics, safety while playing with electricity to take your life style to the next level. They will actually show you step by steps on how to design and make your own printed circuit board from scratch. We will bring etching solution, we will etch out a board with you. Then we will use the popular arduino and netduino platform to control the board remotely from a mobile device."
Chris Risner: Taking your Android Apps to the Cloud with Windows Azure Mobile Services,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Zambezi,Mobile,"Android is fast becoming the number one mobile OS for development. If you want to build Android apps, you NEED to know about using the cloud. In this session, we’ll talk about connecting Android apps to Windows Azure Mobile Services to take advantage of easy data storage, user auth with multiple providers, push notifications and more. You’ll leave knowing how to get an easy to use backend up and running and focus on building a great app."
Nayan Hajratwala: Test Driving User Interfaces,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Portia/Wisteria,Testing,"Test Driving business and persistence logic has been proven to be an effective technique for incremental design, reduced complexity, and easy automated regression testing. Many teams struggle with how to achieve these same benefits for User Interfaces. The traditional notion is that a UI is too fragile and hard to test until it is already built.

This session will consist of a brief explanation of the Page Object pattern, followed by a live coding demo showing the integration of Cucumber-JVM with Selenium via Page Objects. Code will be available on GitHub after the session.

Attendees will come away with an understanding of:
 * the benefits of consolidating structural web page information in a single location
 * how the Page Object pattern can be applied to an existing project
 * the limitations of the Page Object pattern"
James Kovacs: Testable JavaScript,01/10/2013,4:50 PM,5:50 PM,Salon D,Testing,"Your client-side JavaScript is code as worthy of testing as any server-side code that you might write, but often JavaScript testing is ignored. This session will introduce you to QUnit, Jasmine, and Mocha, three popular JavaScript testing frameworks. Come see how you can easily incorporate TDD/BDD techniques into your web development stack and increase your confidence that your JavaScript code is as robust as your server-side code."
Philip Japikse: Testing Code From The Pit Of Despair,01/10/2013,4:50 PM,5:50 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Testing,"Michael Feathers defines Legacy Code as any code that doesn’t have automated tests, and you agree that automated tests are an important facet of successful software development. Then it happens – you get your next assignment, and it’s your worst nightmare! You have to maintain and enhance a large application that has no tests in place, and there are parts that are just plain scary. Where do you start? Traditional Test Driven Development techniques don’t typically work, since they focus on an inside-out development paradigm.

I will show you the patterns and practices that will help you turn the scary big ball of mud into a tested code base."
Howard Lewis Ship: Testing Web Applications with Geb,01/10/2013,11:00 AM,12:00 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Java,"If you build web applications and cringe at the phrase ""but how are we going to test it?"" you're going to love Geb: the browser automation and testing tool. Geb is a Groovy framework for testing web applications: it builds on Selenium, but draws ideas from jQuery and elsewhere to make it productive and fun to test your applications in-browser.

Geb is rich with ideas to keep your tests clear, concise and maintainable. It is useful in all major testing frameworks: JUnit, TestNG, and Spock. We'll see how to navigate around the browser, clicking links, submitting forms, and verifying results. We'll also see Geb Pages and Modules, which allow you to define elements inside a page once, and reference them across many tests. Basically, Geb removes the excuses for not testing your web application, and that's a great thing!"
Christopher H. Laco: Testing: It's Not Just for Your Code,01/11/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Portia/Wisteria,Testing,"Nearly every conference we attend, we're bombarded with modern testing practices. Test Driven Development. Behavior Driven Development. Acceptance Tests. Unit Tests. Integration Tests. Factories. Cucumber. RSpec. Test Unit. On and on and on it goes. These are great tools for our tool belts, but they're all focused on a small portion of our software life cycles; mainly the developer portion.

There is a world outside of red green refactor. In this presentation, we'll take a look at where and how things go wrong. With all green tests and complete coverage, we can use different kinds of tests to reduce the pain, prevent regressions, and deliver strong deployments long after the features are completed.

We've tested our code. Now let's think about Testing Everything Else!

We'll focus on 3 main areas of issue:

- Environment: ""It's works on my machine"", ""The Macbook Pro Bubble"", ""What Firewall?"", ""Connection String Blues"" and other common issues.

- Data Issues: ""Garbage In, Garbage Out"", ""Legacy Business Constraints vs New Technology"",  ""Real World Data vs Developer Data"", ""Index/Duplicate Record Madness"".

- Deployments:  ""All Test Pass Myth"", ""Customers vs. Steakholders"", ""Server Side Tests"", and ""We Don't Need QA"".

Matthew D. Groves: The Class that Knew too Much: Refactoring Spaghetti Code,01/10/2013,4:50 PM,5:50 PM,Indigo Bay,.NET,"The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have one (and only one) reason to change. Classes that don't adhere to this principle can result in tightly coupled spaghetti code that leads to more bugs and higher maintenance. We'll look at how to identify these classes by using some heuristics and looking for ""code smells"", and we'll clean them up using refactoring tools, design patterns, dependency injection and even aspect-oriented programming. Examples will be in C#, but the concepts can be applied to a variety of languages."
Peter Ritchie: The Evolution of Asynchronous Programming on .NET ,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Guava/Tamarind,.NET,"Everything you wanted the know about asynchronous programming in .NET, but were afraid to ask. 

Multithreaded programming is hard.  the latest version of Visual Studio includes language additions to C# and VB to make it much easier to write asynchronous code (the async and await keywords).

.NET has had numerous ways to implement asynchonous and lenghty operations over the years.  This session details some of these techniques, their benefits and their drawbacks.  This session also details the progression of these techniques leading up to async/await in an effort to better understand the new syntax as well as better understand how to migrate existing asynchronous code to the new syntax.  As well, this session allows you to increase your expertise with several advanced language features that the new syntax and existing patterns build on, like lamdas, anonymous methods, closures, etc."
Doug Alcorn: The Holy Grail: Getting Your Customer to Write Acceptance Tests,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Sagewood/Zebrawood,Testing,"For as long as I've been testing code, we've talked about getting the customer to write the tests. Cucumber is the latest contender vying for this lofty goal. I largely passed on Cucumber as an additional step adding a needless layer of complexity between the tests and code. That's true as long as the customers aren't reading or writing the tests. By writing the specs at the appropriate level of detail, customers can actually engage in the process. The result is profound conversations with your customer about how the system actually works and how it should work. In this session, we'll walk through the feature development process and show how we get our customers involved."
JC Grubbs: The Native/Mobile Web: Beyond the Basics with PhoneGap,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Indigo Bay,Mobile,"Phonegap (also known as Cordova) is a powerful cross-platform tool for building mobile applications with standard web technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS.  While the framework is extremely simple, it can be difficult to make the switch from thinking about web applications to thinking about mobile applications.  There are performance pitfalls, and code-organization concerns, and tricky development environments.

In this talk, JC will walk us through a real working Phonegap application built using Backbone.js, Require.js, and a smattering of other open source tools and all covered by an automated test suite.  The presentation will cover the following:

- How to organize our application and its dependencies
- Dealing with local vs. remote data
- Creating a simple build process for packaging your app for deployment to multiple targets (iOS and Android)
- Dealing with the performance gotchas when working with web technologies on mobile devices
- Debugging a remote mobile web application"
Brandon Rhodes: Touring the Universe with Scientific Python,01/11/2013,10:45 AM,11:45 AM,Salon E,Python,"Python is big in the world of science, bringing the power of a general-purpose language to domains traditionally dominated by languages like FORTRAN and Matlab. But the statistics and visualization power-tools that draw scientists to Python can be daunting at first for people in other fields. This talk will use a common human birthright, the sky full of stars and planets and galaxies, to take an illustrated whirlwind tour of the ways that Python can be used to analyze, process, and visualize complex science-grade data, and will then bring the lessons back home by showing how the same tools can be used on data like your Apache logs, user demographics, and application performance. And you might even learn a bit of astronomy in the process!"
Guy Royse: Understanding Prototypal Inheritance,01/10/2013,9:45 AM,10:45 AM,Salon D,JavaScript,"One the most misunderstood concepts in JavaScript is prototypal inheritance.  Prototypal inheritance is nothing like classical inheritance but is actually quiet easy to grasp once you let go of the bounds of classes and instances.  In this session we will explore the nature of JavaScript objects, how they inherit from one another, and why everyone thought this prototype stuff was so hard in the first place.

Since shipping code is painful, they put it off and do less of it. No good. We need to make deployment easy and enjoyable. Capistrano is a fantastic remote server automation tool which works wonderfully for automating deployments and other server tasks. Written in Ruby, it has seen a lot of adoption for deploying rails applications. Since falling in love with this library, our office decided to apply it to every project we're involved with — including PHP content management systems. We will cover a brief introduction to Capistrano and discuss real world examples of how we've used it to make our team more productive. Automating deployment has changed the way we work in a great way. "
Jeff Kelley: Using Images in iOS,01/10/2013,4:50 PM,5:50 PM,Salon A,Mac/iPhone,"This talk will cover using images in iOS, from loading from the disk and network efficiently to creating images from scratch in your iOS app. WIth five separate screen resolutions to account for, images can quickly get out of hand, increasing the size of your binary and making it a nightmare to support. We'll look at making stretchable images that can support any resolution, creating thumbnails of large images, and even look at a new library I've created for rendering images on the fly. "

Daniel Bower: Version your database on nearly any platform with Liquibase,01/11/2013,3:35 PM,4:35 PM,Sagewood/Zebrawood,Continuous Deployment,"If you are still writing one-off scripts to manage your database, then it is time to make your life much simpler and less error-prone.  
We'll spend the time discussing Liquibase, a tool that will help you to manage that process.  It will even allow you to check your schema and seed data into source-control, and get new environments up and running quickly.  This session will focus not on the merits of using such a tool, but on its workflow and implementation in a project.  We'll run through the majority of features from the command-line, demonstrating that as long as a Java Runtime Environment (jre) is available, Liquibase can be used during deployments on any platform.  We'll also touch on usage with maven and quirks of Liquibase that are good to know ahead of time."
Jim Weirich: Vital Testing (Tuesday Half Day PM),01/08/2013,1:30 PM,5:30 PM,D,Testing,"This workshop is for the testing-minded developer who would like to sharpen their testing skills. Are you unsatisfied with the your test coverage? Or maybe you find that your unit tests tend to break when you refactor. Or maybe you just can't seem to get your tests to help drive your design direction.

Whatever your testing shortcomings, this workshop will allow you to practice your testing skills is a series of short, focused coding exercises. The workshop will begin with a talk on testing strategies and skills covering things like: starting with failing test; selecting what to test next; making sure the test fails; focusing on behavior, not implementation; and writing readable, non-brittle tests.

After the talk you will participate in a testing self assessment to see where you need to improve. The rest of the workshop will be an opportunity to pair with like-minded individuals and practice those skills that need improvement.

Testing is no longer an optional part of software development, it is an integral part of writing solid code. Come join us as we improve this vital skill.

Michael Crute: Web Development with Python and Django (Wednesday Full Day),01/09/2013,8:30 AM,5:30 PM,Indigo,Python,"New to web development? Want to check out a new language? Join us in an exploration of Python by way of the Django web framework. Python has been around for over 20 years and has a well-deserved reputation of being easy to learn and very useful for quick prototyping. Django is a web framework written in Python ""for perfectionists with deadlines."" We'll introduce the Python language and the Django framework through a project that will result in a fully functional, tested site where users can submit proposals and receive feedback. We'll cover some of the neat time-saving applications that ship with Django and finish with a simple read-only JSON/REST API that could be used to power mobile applications. No Python or web development experience is required; we'll provide the HTML, CSS and Javascript so you can focus on server-side development. Bring your laptop and join us for a tour of Python and Django!"

Michael S. Collier: Windows Azure: Lessons from the Field,01/10/2013,1:45 PM,2:45 PM,Rosewood,Other,"The demos and presentations that show you how awesome a certain technology is are certainly exciting. But, let’s be real – there are often times when the demo “happy path” doesn’t work for real-world projects. Creating production ready Windows Azure applications often requires deviating from the “next, next, publish, magic, let’s party” path often seen. In this session we will pull back the curtain on common Windows Azure scenarios such as debugging and diagnostics, environment setup, build and deployment process, Access Control Service (ACS), and role upgrades – just to name a few. Coming away from this session you’ll have gained valuable, real-world inspired knowledge you can apply to your Windows Azure applications right now!"
